# Kids Code
Coding projects for kids

## What you need
- [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/get-started?tabs=windows)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)


### Setup
Open a command prompt / terminal and run the following commands:  
`git clone https://github.com/matt-dot-net/kids.git`  
`cd kids`  
`kids.sln`

#### Work and Testing
You can run all tests with _Ctrl+R, A_.  That means, hold _Ctrl_ and _R_ (think run tests) and then press _A_ (think 'All'). Each project,  like `variables` has a test project, like `variables-test`.  Test projects will determine if you have implemented the code correctly.  Once you impelment the `//TODO` code and run the tests, they should pass and you can move on.
